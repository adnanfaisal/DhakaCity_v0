Located on the banks of the Buriganga River, Dhaka has a history dating back to the 7th century. The city boasts a blend of Mughal, Islamic, and colonial architectural influences. Dhaka is known for its vibrant markets, including New Market and Gulshan Market, offering a wide range of local handicrafts, textiles, and street food. The city is home to numerous historical landmarks, such as the Lalbagh Fort, Ahsan Manzil, and the Liberation War Museum.
